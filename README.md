# TIC-TAC-toe_OpenGL

Tic-tac-toe game on C++ and OpenGL

Attempt to implement the "Tic-Tac-toe" console project via the OpenGL library. A project of our own development (at the initial stage). It was not completed due to lack of time and opportunity. The accumulated knowledge and experience from lessons from the Internet were used. This program implements field drawing and the ability to place "crosses".
